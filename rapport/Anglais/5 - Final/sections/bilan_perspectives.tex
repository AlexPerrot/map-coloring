\section{Prospect}
For a more complete study, it would be interesting to perform simulations on other graphs and to be able to generate the theoretical calculated values on the spot, instead of calculating by hand.


To gain in performances and to accelerate the experiments, we could parallelize the simulations.


It would be interesting to look a little more into Bob's strategies. We considered that Bob and Alice played symmetrically (if a move is bad for Alice, then it is good for Bob), but a bad move for Bob on the short term may be good for him in the end.
