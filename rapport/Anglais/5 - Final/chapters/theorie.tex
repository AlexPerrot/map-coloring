\chapter{Theory}

To understand the strategies that follow, we first introduce three important concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item the order of a graph $G$
\item the loose backward neighbors
\item the number of 2-coloring of a graph $G$, denoted $col_{2}(G)$
\item the chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi(G)$
\item the game chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_{g}(G)$
\end{itemize}


The chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors to make a good coloring of $G$.

The game chromatic number is the number of allowed colors for which Alice always has a winning strategy.

The order of a graph $G$ is a linear representation of the vertices of the graph where we associate an index to each vertex according to its position in the order.

For the loose backward neighbor, we define an order of the graph $G$: $v_{1} v_{2} v_{3}... v_{n}$. A vertex $v_{h}$ is a loose backward neighbor of $v_{i}$ if $h < i$ and if $v_{h}$ is in $v_{i}$ neighborhood, or if $v_{h}$ and $v_{i}$ have a common neighbor $v_{j}$ such as $ h < i < j$.

Now, let's review the whole range of orders for a graph $G$. For each order found, we determine the integer $k$ such as each vertex of the order has a number of loose backward neighbors $<$ to $k$. We keep the order which has the smallest $k$. This $k$ is the number of 2-coloring. In addition, the associated order satisfies $col_{2}(G)$.
