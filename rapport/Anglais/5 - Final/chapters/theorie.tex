\chapter{Theory}

To understand the strategies that follow, we first introduce three important concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item the order of a graph $G$
\item the loose backward neighbors
\item The number of 2-coloring of a graph $G$, denoted $col_{2}(G)$
\end{itemize}

The order of a graph $G$ is a linear representation of the vertices of the graph where we associate an index to each vertex according to its position in the order.

For the loose backward neighbor, we define an order of the graph $G$: $v_{1} v_{2} v_{3}... v_{n}$. A vertex $v_{h}$ is a loose backward neighbor of $v_{i}$ if $h < i$ and if $v_{h}$ is in $v_{i}$ neighborhood, or if $v_{h}$ and $v_{i}$ have a common neighbor $v_{j}$ such as $ h < i < j$.

Now, let's review the whole range of orders for a graph $G$. For each order found, we determine the integer $k$ such as each vertex of the order has an number of loose backward neighbors $<$ to $k$. We keep the order which has the smallest $k$. This $k$ is the number of 2-coloring. In addition, the associated order satisfies $col_{2}(G)$.
