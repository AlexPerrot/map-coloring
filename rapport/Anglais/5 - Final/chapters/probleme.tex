\section*{Abstract}
This document is the final report of a research project carried out by a group of 5 students within their year of Master 2.

The project addresses the graph coloring game, a variant of the graph coloring problem, by using Monte Carlo heuristics and statistical tools to determine whether the theoretical bounds calculated by the researchers can be improved.

The results, presented in detail later, suggest that the current theoretical bounds can be significantly improved.
